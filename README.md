<h1>WebRTC</h1>
The WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication) API allows us to communicate peer to peer without the hassle of setting up network communication protocols, NAT traversals, different audio and video codecs, etc.

Note: NAT (Network Address Translation) is the mechanism by which the devices on a network are given public IPs to communicate on the internet.

<h1> Warning</h1>
Using this application on institute network may prevent it from working due to unusual network configurations, so use mobile data in that case.
